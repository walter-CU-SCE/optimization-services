However, unlike before there is a separate download for some necessary swt jars.  Download from below.

Copy the new swt.jar into the OS Common lib folder.  Also modify the JVM argument appropriately so you have something like the below modified for  your machine.

-Djava.library.path=/Applications/eclipse/swt-3.1-carbon-macosx-ppc (for mac/unix)
-Djava.library.path=C:\eclipse\workspace\OSCommon\lib\swtwinlib (for windows)
