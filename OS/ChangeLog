	* Changes to Trunk

	* applications/amplClient/OSAmplClient.cpp -- added the feature that this reads an OSoL
	 file which is given as an option file and sends it on to the solver.
	
	* applications/amplClient/OSAmplClient/OSAmplClient.cpp -- changed the solver defaut selection, if no options are specified using 
	 {\bf OSAmplClient\_options}, by default, for continuous linear models  clp is used. 
	 For continuous nonlinear models ipopt is used. For mixed-integer linear models (MIP), cbc is used. 
	 For mixed-integer nonlinear models  bonmin is used.  All solvers are invoked locally. 
	 
	* src/OSSolverService.cpp -- changed the solver defaut selection, if no options are specified using 
	 {\bf OSAmplClient\_options}, by default, for continuous linear models  clp is used. 
	 For continuous nonlinear models ipopt is used. For mixed-integer linear models (MIP), cbc is used. 
	 For mixed-integer nonlinear models  bonmin is used.  All solvers are invoked locally.
	 
	* src/OSModelInterfaces/OSgams2osil.cpp(h) -- added these two files.  This allows for reading of the GAMS
	 .dat format and converting to OSiL.
	 
	* src/OSAgent/OSWSUtil.cpp -- changed the soapify() and defsoapify() to allow for encasing the OSiL, OSoL, OSrL,
	 to be encased in a CDATA section to speed-up processing
	 
	* Ticket #12 change src/OSSolverInterfaces/OSIpotSolver.cpp to report reduced costs in the result
	
	* Ticket #13 change in src/OSSolverInterfaces/ the solver interfaces to work with either 0 variables
	 specified or an empty variables variables section. Also changed the OSiL parser to allow for an empty
	 variables section.
