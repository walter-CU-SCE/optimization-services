Creating the Knitro Dll:

Step 0:  From Richard Waltz we have the knitro.lib. We created the
file KnitroSolver.c. We also need the jni.h file which should come
with the Java SDK.  Note:  There should also be the line

System.loadLibrary("./Knitro/KnitroSolver");

in the KnitroSolver.java class.

Step 1: Execute in the OSSolver directory the command:


C:\Documents and Settings\kmartin\My
Documents\research\junma\OS\OSSolver>javah
bin\org\optimizationservices\ossolver\solver\KnitroSolver

This creates the header file:

bin_0005corg_0005coptimizationservices_0005cossolver_0005csolver_0005cKnitroSolver.h


Step 2: Rename the header file to
org_optimizationservices_ossolver_solver_KnitroSolver.h and move
to the include subdirectory in Knitro


Step 3:  Now run the following makefile

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
CC = cl KNITROINCLUDE = ./include



KnitroSolver.dll: KnitroSolver.obj
    link   -NODEFAULTLIB:LIBC.lib KnitroSolver.obj ./lib/knitro.lib -DLL -out:KnitroSolver.dll
    del KnitroSolver.obj

KnitroSolver.obj: KnitroSolver.c
    $(CC) -c  -I$(KNITROINCLUDE) KnitroSolver.c



ALL: KnitroSolver.obj KnitroSolver.dll

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Note: there are three files that get created we only need
KnitroSolver.dll
