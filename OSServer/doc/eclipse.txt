= Eclipse Configuration =

This is a work in progress document, please feel free to comment/file
a bug against this.

== Install ==

* Install a local copy of OS or CoinAll (see scripts/coin-or.sh and scripts/coin-or-install.sh)
* Install a local copy of Tomcat 6
 * for Ubuntu run scripts/tomcat6-user.sh in OSServer, this will add
   a server to ../Servers/tomcat6
 * run python test/test.py to test.
   * Upon failure it will indicate where a copy, or symlink to the OSSolverService should be placed for example:
{{{
cd workspace
ln -sf /opt/coinall/bin/OSSolverService .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.wst.server.core/tmp0/wtpwebapps/OSServer//WEB-INF/code/solver/OSSolverServiceLinux
}}} 

== Build Notes ==

Web service was created by right clicking OSSolverService and
selecting Web Services > Create Web Service.  The current Eclipse is
broken in this regards, so the files here are from earlier work as
OSSolverService should be ported to Axis2 at some point.

Eclipse/SVN does not save the .settings directory so some aspects of
the project are lost across machines/development.  Detailed
instructions will be provided after testing with other people and
envrionments. The following steps where done and should provide
guidence if your one on the lucky onces.
 * Project Settings > Project Facts
   * Dynamic Web Module
   * Java
 * Project Settings > Java EE Dependencies 
   * OSServer depends on OSCommon and OSLib 
   * OSLib and OSCommon export jars and classpath.
