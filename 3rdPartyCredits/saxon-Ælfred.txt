?lfred

Included in the Saxon distribution is a modified version of the ?lfred XML parser from Microstar. I have taken the relevant part of David Brownell's ?lfred2 distribution, repackaged it, and fixed a few bugs. All cahnges are clearly documented in the source code.

The version included with Saxon is David Brownell's code of 26 Feb 2000, modified as follows:

    * Changed the package name to com.icl.saxon.aelfred to prevent any accidental confusion with the original Microstar code or with David Brownell's version.
    * Fixed several bugs: (1) a bug in namespace handling (where an attribute xxx:name precedes the xmlns:xxx declaration) (2) poor diagnostics when end of file occurs prematurely
    * Subsetting the code to include only the XML non-validating parser and SAX driver, with appropriate changes to the setFeature() and getFeature() methods.
    * Some further changes made by David Brownell up to June 2001 have been incorporated.
